This program will rename your files with spaces to underscores. For example file *“My project”*, will be renamed to *“My_project”*. This is vary useful when you work with files in terminal or cmd.

Just run program using **“java -jar FileRenamer.jar”** and it will ask you for file. If you want to rename all files in directory where is jar located, just type “dir” or “folder”. When you have your work done and you want to exit just type “exit” and program will exit.

This is all, it’s very simply. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/Bakterio/FileRenamer/releases/download/done/FileRenamer.jar). Have fun.
